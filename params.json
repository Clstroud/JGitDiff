{"name":"JGitDiff","tagline":"Java utility for creating a consolidated diff report between two Git commits","body":"JGitDiff\r\n==============\r\n\r\nThis is a Java utility designed to take two commits in a (local) repository and create a more readily-digestible\r\nreport of the changes that occurred between them. This is specifically designed to only report **3** types of files\r\nas of this writing:\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n* .java\r\n* .jsp\r\n* .sql \r\n\r\nThis was essentially designed to meet the needs of NC State's CSC-326 (Undergraduate Software Engineering) course, but could be\r\nadapted to other types of projects if desired. The overall goal is to produce a plaintext summary of what files\r\nwere changed and, if a Java class, what methods were changed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n=============\r\nEvery class is fully JavaDoc'd and browsable [here](clstroud.github.io/JGitDiff/)\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n======\r\nIt's made to be nice and simple, but please view the usage guide [here](https://github.com/Clstroud/JGitDiff/wiki/Usage)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
